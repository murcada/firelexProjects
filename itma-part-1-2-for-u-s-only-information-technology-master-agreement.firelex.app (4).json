In such case, the Deliverable will become part of the On-Premise Software or SaaS upon Acceptance, and from that point such Deliverable will be subject to the intellectual property rights, warranties, and other terms related to such On-Premise Software or SaaS in the relevant Software/SaaS Addendum and elsewhere in this Agreement.`\n);\n\ndocument.addParagraph(\n    'Agreement Level 2',\n    `Other Deliverables; License. If a Deliverable does not become part of the On-Premise Software or SaaS pursuant to Section 20.1 above, Vendor hereby grants Customer a nonexclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, worldwide license to reproduce, create derivative works from, publicly display, publicly perform, make, have made, import, and use each Deliverable, with the right to sublicense each and every such right. Vendor also forever waives and agrees never to assert any “moral rights” (no matter how designated) with respect to any Deliverable referenced in the preceding sentence against Customer or its licensees, even after termination of this Agreement.`\n);\n\ndocument.addParagraph(\n    'Agreement Level 1',\n    `SERVICE & DELIVERABLES WARRANTIES. Vendor represents and warrants that: (a) the Professional Services will be provided in a workmanlike manner and with the highest professional standards and practices; (b) each technology Deliverable will perform according to its Specifications for a period of 1 year following Acceptance, or for such other period as is set forth in the relevant Statement of Work Addendum; and (c) Vendor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulation in connection with the performance of the Professional Services, including without limitation laws, rules, and regulations governing discrimination in contracting and employment. Without limiting any remedies of Customer, Vendor shall promptly repair or replace any Deliverable involved in a breach of the warranty in Section 21(b) above.`\n);\n\ndocument.addParagraph(\n    'Agreement Level 1',\n    `NONSOLICITATION. During the term of this Agreement and for 1 year after termination, Vendor shall not solicit any of Customer’s employees involved in Professional Services to consider alternate employment. For the avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence does not forbid a solicitation to the general public. For each employee who quits as a result of breach of this Article 22, the soliciting party Vendor shall pay Customer ${form.getFieldValue(\n        'liquidDamagesNonsolicitation'\n    )} as liquidated damages. The parties agree that the damages set forth in the preceding sentence are liquidated damages and not penalties and that they are reasonable in light of the harm that would be caused by breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience and infeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.`\n);\n\ndocument.addParagraph(\n    'Agreement Level 1',\n    `VENDOR’S PERSONNEL. Vendor shall assign personnel of such skill levels as is necessary to perform Professional Services. Vendor shall replace any person providing Professional Services as soon as reasonably practicable, not to exceed 10 business days, after Customer indicates dissatisfaction with such person in writing, which Customer may do for any reason that does not violate applicable law, in its sole discretion.`\n);\n\ndocument.addParagraph(\n    'Agreement Level 1',\n    `INSURANCE. During the term of this Agreement and for one year thereafter, Vendor shall maintain in full force and effect: (A) business automobile liability insurance for all vehicles, including those owned or rented by Vendor or its employees, covering personal injury and property damage, with a limit of at least ${form.getFieldValue(\n        'minCommAutoPerOccur'\n    )} per occurrence; and (B) worker’s compensation and employer’s liability insurance as required by statute in each jurisdiction in which Vendor provides Professional Services. Vendor shall comply with the requirements listed in Subsections 11.1 and 11.2 above with respect to the coverages listed in this Article 24.`\n);\n"
